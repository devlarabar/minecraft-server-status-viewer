This is a simple app that enables the user to input a server address for any Minecraft Java Edition server. The app will display the following information about the server:
- If the server is online
- The usernames of all players currently active in the server
- The maximum allowable number of players
- Any detected plugins
- The version of Minecraft the server is running

This app pulls the data using this <a href="https://api.mcsrvstat.us/">this API</a>.
